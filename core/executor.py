"""Stage 5 — Parallel candidate execution and scoring.

CandidateExecutor runs all SQL candidates concurrently, scores each one on
three dimensions, and returns the highest-scoring candidate for the pipeline.

Each candidate is gated by an EXPLAIN pre-flight (when ``use_explain_gate``
is enabled, the default). If EXPLAIN fails, the candidate is marked as a
failed execution without a real query roundtrip — saving the expensive
slot for syntactically valid candidates. EXPLAIN is also free of side
effects and respects the same read-only invariants as a regular query.

Scoring rubric (total = 1.0):
  syntax_score      0.5  — 1.0 if execution succeeded, 0.0 otherwise
  empty_score       0.2  — 0.5 if result has at least one row, 0.0 otherwise
  consistency_score 0.3  — fraction of other successful results that share
                           the same column names (agreement signal)
